# Urban Green Cover Analysis: An Interactive Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of urban green cover, measured by the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), for nine major Indian cities from 2010 to 2023. The core of this project is a dynamic, multi-page Power BI dashboard that transforms a raw CSV dataset into an interactive and insightful analytical tool.

The dashboard is designed for a wide audience, including urban planners, environmental researchers, policymakers, and data enthusiasts, allowing them to explore trends, compare cities, and understand the seasonal dynamics of urban vegetation.

### Key Metrics & Concepts
*   **NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index):** A satellite-based indicator for the presence and health of green vegetation. Higher values signify denser and healthier plant life.
*   **Seasonality:** The analysis of cyclical patterns in green cover, primarily driven by climate events like monsoons.
*   **Year-over-Year (YoY) Change:** A metric to track the annual progress or decline in a city's greenness.

## Features

The Power BI report is structured into four distinct pages, each serving a specific analytical purpose:

### 1. üèôÔ∏è Executive Overview
A high-level summary of the national urban green cover landscape.
*   **KPI Cards:** At-a-glance metrics for overall average NDVI, the top-performing ("greenest") city, and peak recorded greenness.
*   **Geographic Map:** Visualizes the distribution and intensity of green cover across India.
*   **City Ranking:** A dynamic bar chart ranking cities by their average NDVI, sortable by year.
*   **Annual Trend Comparison:** A line chart for comparing the long-term greenness trajectories of multiple cities simultaneously.

### 2. üå≥ City Deep-Dive
A focused analytical page to explore the unique profile of a single selected city.
*   **Dynamic KPIs:** Key statistics update automatically based on the city chosen.
*   **Historical Trend Analysis:** A detailed line chart showing the monthly evolution of NDVI over the 14-year period, complete with a trend line.
*   **Seasonal Pattern Cycle:** A chart illustrating the "typical year" for a city's vegetation, clearly showing the impact of seasons.
*   **Performance Tracker:** A column chart displaying the year-over-year percentage change in green cover, highlighting periods of significant growth or decline.

### 3. üÜö Comparative Analysis
A powerful tool for a direct, head-to-head comparison of any two cities.
*   **Dual Slicers:** Independent dropdowns to select two cities for comparison.
*   **Comparative Trend Charts:** Overlaid line charts for directly comparing historical and seasonal NDVI patterns.


### 4. ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info & Methodology
A crucial page that builds trust and provides context for the data.
*   **Clear Definitions:** Explanations of NDVI and key terms.
*   **Data Transparency:** Details on the data source, time period, and processing steps.
*   **User Guide:** Simple instructions on how to use and navigate the dashboard.
